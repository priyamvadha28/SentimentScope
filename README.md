# SentimentScope
This project leverages Azure OpenAI's LLM to analyze client feedback, categorizing it into "progressive," "lagging," "stagnant," or "unclear" sentiments. It preprocesses the text data, applies a structured prompt to the LLM, and retrieves sentiment scores and justifications, providing precise and interpretable sentiment insights.
